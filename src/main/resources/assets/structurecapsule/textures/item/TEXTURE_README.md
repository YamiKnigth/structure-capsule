# Texture Placeholders

This directory should contain the texture files for the mod items:

- `empty_capsule.png` - A 16x16 texture for the empty capsule item
- `filled_capsule.png` - A 16x16 texture for the filled capsule item

## Recommended Design

**Empty Capsule**: 
- Could look like an empty glass sphere or container
- Transparent/translucent appearance
- Perhaps with a glowing outline

**Filled Capsule**:
- Similar to empty but with a glowing core or swirling energy inside
- Different color to distinguish from empty
- Could have particles or magical appearance

## Creating Textures

You can create these textures using any pixel art tool like:
- GIMP
- Aseprite
- Paint.NET
- Minecraft texture editors

Save as PNG format at 16x16 resolution.
